# design-data utilities

DESCRIPTION
In July of 2017, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting requested a data set from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, and has published it in its raw format.

Code for Tulsa and Asemio will be hosting an event at 36Â°N in Tulsa, OK to review the dataset, understand what's in it, and begin to organize the data so that it is meaningful and useful to journalists, policy analysts, lawyers, and anyone else working in criminal justice.  [Go here if you are interested in attending the event.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/designdata-criminal-justice-in-ok-tickets-39290102755?utm_source=eb_email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=order_confirmation_email&utm_term=eventname&ref=eemailordconf)
