# Files
## zip2json.py (work in progress):
Reads the contents of the zip file and (eventually) scans each line and converts to a stream of json objects.


## zip2neo.py:
Reads the files in the zip file, creates cypher statments for a neo4jy database.  Dependencies and database credentials must be provided.
